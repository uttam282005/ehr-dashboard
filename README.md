# Healthcare API Integration

## Project Overview

This project implements a secure, scalable Healthcare API Integration system using Next.js, Redis, and Modernizing Medicineâ€™s proprietary and FHIR APIs. It supports core operations including patient management, appointment scheduling, and authentication with OAuth 2.0 token management. The goal is to provide standardized, FHIR-compliant RESTful APIs for healthcare data interaction.

## Features

- OAuth 2.0 based authentication and token management with Redis storage  
- Patient CRUD and search operations  
- Appointment CRUD and search operations  
- FHIR v4 compatible resource representation  
- Modular, environment-configurable Next.js backend  
- Postman collection for API testing and documentation  

***

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >14.x  
- Redis server or Redis cloud instance  
- API credentials for Modernizing Medicine sandbox or production  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone <repo-url>`  
2. Install dependencies:  
   `npm install`  
3. Configure environment variables for:  
   - Base API URL  
   - Firm URL prefix  
   - Redis connection details  
   - API keys and secrets  
4. Run the development server:  
   `npm run dev`

## API Documentation

Detailed docs for:

- Patient API: CRUD and search  
- Appointment API: CRUD and search  
- Authentication API: Token management with Redis caching  

Refer to `/docs` or the included Postman collection for full endpoint specs and example requests.

***

## Architecture

The backend uses Next.js serverless functions for endpoints, Redis for caching tokens and session data, and integrates with Modernizing Medicine's external healthcare APIs using OAuth 2.0. The system is designed for scalability, security, and compliance with healthcare data standards.

***

## Limitations & Edge Cases

- Location IDs are not mapped to human-readable location names yet  
- Limited support for practitioner, referral, and additional healthcare resources  
- Basic error handling and no webhook support currently  
- Pagination is basic without complex filtering capabilities  
- No audit logging or role-based authorization implemented
