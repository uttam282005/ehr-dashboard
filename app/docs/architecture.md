# Architecture Document: Healthcare API Integration System

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the Healthcare API Integration System designed to provide secure, scalable, and compliant access to Electronic Health Records (EHR) functionalities including patient management, appointment scheduling, and authentication services. The system integrates with Modernizing Medicineâ€™s proprietary and FHIR APIs, leveraging Next.js as a backend framework and Redis for token and session management.

## Goals

- Provide RESTful, FHIR-compliant API access to healthcare data and operations.
- Ensure robust authentication and authorization using OAuth 2.0 flows.
- Deliver performant, scalable endpoints with secure session and token handling.
- Maintain high availability through stateless API design and centralized caching.
- Facilitate easy extension with modular endpoint architecture.

***

## System Components

### 1. API Gateway / Next.js Backend

- Routes HTTP requests to appropriate API endpoints.
- Implements core business logic for CRUD operations on Patients, Appointments, etc.
- Provides OAuth2 token exchange support at `/api/get-tokens`.
- Uses environment-based configuration (`baseUrl`, `firmUrlPrefix`) for targeting different practice sandboxes or production.
- Enforces request validation, authentication, and error handling.

### 2. Redis Cache

- Stores OAuth2 `access_token`, `refresh_token`, and associated `apiKey` securely.
- Manages token expiration and quick retrieval for session validation.
- Supports distributed cache architecture for scalability.

### 3. External EHR APIs (Modernizing Medicine)

- Proprietary API endpoints for Patient, Appointment, and other healthcare resources.
- Uses OAuth2 bearer tokens with API keys for secured access.
- Provides paginated and search-filtered data to client requests.
- Standardized according to FHIR v4 specifications.

### 4. Frontend Dashboard (Optional)

- Interface allowing users to interact with patient and appointment data.
- Manages authentication flow via backend proxy.
- Utilizes Postman collections for API testing and demonstration.

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**

   - Client sends credentials to `/api/get-tokens`.
   - Backend requests tokens from EHR authorization server.
   - Retrieved tokens cached in Redis with TTL.
   - Subsequent API calls use cached tokens for authorization.

2. **API Request Handling**

   - Client requests made for patient or appointment resources.
   - Backend validates token via Redis cache.
   - Requests proxied/served by Next.js API routes implementing business logic.
   - Data fetched/updated on EHR external APIs.
   - Response returned in standardized FHIR JSON format.

***

## Security

- OAuth 2.0 used for secured user authentication and authorization.
- Tokens stored securely with Redis with expiry to minimize risk.
- API keys required for all protected calls with header validation.
- HTTPS enforced for all external and internal communications.
- Input validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

***

## Scalability & Performance

- Stateless Next.js API routes enable horizontal scaling.
- Redis caching reduces redundant token fetches and improves latency.
- Pagination and query parameters limit data transfer sizes.
- Modular route structure allows independent feature scaling.

***

## Error Handling & Logging

- Uses standard HTTP status codes for client feedback.
- Centralized logging captures errors and audit trails.
- Structured error responses with codes and messages for client-side handling.
- Retries and fallback mechanisms for external API failures.

***

## Environment Configuration

- Supports multiple environments: Development, Sandbox, Production.
- Environment variables configure `baseUrl`, `firmUrlPrefix`, Redis connection, and secret keys.
- Feature flags for toggling integrations or features during rollouts.

## Future Enhancements

- Add webhook support for real-time updates.
- Implement token refresh and revocation workflows with Redis.
- Expand resource coverage beyond Patients and Appointments.
- Add audit logging for regulatory compliance.
- Develop comprehensive automated test suite.
