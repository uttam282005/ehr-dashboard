# Edge Cases and Limitations

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty or Missing Fields**
   - Patient or appointment requests may omit optional or required fields. Proper validation is required to handle missing critical information gracefully without crashing.
2. **Pagination Boundaries**
   - Requests for pages beyond the last available page should return an empty list or appropriate metadata without error.
3. **Invalid Identifiers**
   - Requests using invalid patient or appointment IDs must return a clear 404 Not Found response.
4. **Token Expiry and Revocation**
   - Access tokens stored in Redis may expire during active sessions. The system should handle refresh token failures and prompt re-authentication.
5. **Concurrent Updates**
   - Multiple simultaneous updates to the same patient or appointment resource may cause conflicts. Optimistic locking or last-write-wins strategies may be considered.
6. **Partial Updates**
   - Updates with partial information (PATCH-like scenarios) must ensure no unintended data erasure occurs.
7. **Malformed Requests**
   - Invalid JSON or incorrect parameter types should yield appropriate 400 Bad Request errors.
8. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Requests exceeding the allowed rate must respond with 429 Too Many Requests and appropriate retry instructions.

## Limitations

1. **Location ID Not Mapped to Names**
   - The current implementation does not resolve location IDs to human-readable names, causing unclear location data in responses.
2. **Limited Resource Coverage**
   - The system currently supports only Patient and Appointment endpoints, missing additional vital endpoints like Practitioner, Coverage, Encounter, etc.
3. **No Referral or Practitioner Detail Linking**
   - Practitioner references in patients or appointments are not expanded to detailed resource views, limiting integration depth.
4. **Lack of Advanced Search**
   - Search endpoints support only basic filtering; complex queries (e.g., multi-parameter AND/OR logic) are not implemented.
5. **No Real-time Updates or Webhooks**
   - There is no mechanism for real-time event notifications or webhook callbacks for resource changes.
6. **Basic Error Handling and Reporting**
   - Error responses provide limited context; detailed troubleshooting information or error codes may be insufficient.
7. **No Support for Bulk Operations**
   - The API does not support batch queries or bulk resource manipulation.
8. **Minimal Audit and Logging**
   - Audit trails for data access or modification are limited or absent, reducing traceability and compliance support.
9. **Authentication Simplified**
   - Current token management is basic; advanced scopes, roles, or consent management is yet to be implemented.
10. **Limited Documentation on Data Extensions**
    - Extensions such as ethnicity, race, or social determinants of health are incompletely documented or unsupported.
